# Potions
Postions is an app that keeps an editable list of potions, and selects a random potion from the list. 
This is an for use with the worlds greatest role game: Dungeon's & Dragons. The current default list of potions 
cover all of the standard things from the first edition of the game. This should work with all of the OSR versions out there:
D&D, AD&D, Labyrinth Lord, Swords and Wizardry, Dungeon Crawl Classiscs, and Lamentations of the Flame Princess etc. 

#Info
The app is written in Swift. It uses Realm as a Data base to store and manage potions. You can download the app from the 
iTunes store [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/potions-generator/id951378721?mt=8), or visit the web
